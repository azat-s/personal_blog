It's been about two and a half years since I've written my first line of code. Today I am a mid-level front-end developer at a blockchain startup. The road from where I was to where I am now was not an easy one, though I had a fair share of luck on my side during the journey.

## Background

Until the recent years, **programming** as a career path was never an option for me. I was bad at math from middle school and natural languages always came easier to me than any other subject. I grew up as a native Russian speaker and picked up basic English by playing video games and listening to American music. After high school, I went to a provincial college and chose Translation Studies as my major, for lack of options (and abilities). Fresh out of college, I worked as an English tutor and later an interpreter on a cement plant of all places. I never really enjoyed translation. I was never proud of my work in part because it was hard for me to estimate its quality. It all felt very subjective.
```javascript
console.log('hello');
```

Three years after graduating, I was working in the public sector translating school textbooks. Unsatisfied with my career, I was pressed tightly under the soul-crushing weight of government office work. I started looking into remote job market, which was flooded with developer positions. It was decided then and there. I quit my job, got a small-time gig as a copywriter for a blockchain news website and started learning programming.

## Hello, World

November 2018. I was working part-time as a copywriter and learning programming. Before I was ready to decide which sort of developer I was going to be, I needed an introduction to programming to see whether I even liked it at all. I made a research on which language was the easiest and most beginner-friendly and, as you might have guessed, I was lead to Python. I decided to go with MIT's MOOC [Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python. This course gave me the fundamentals of Computer Science and programming. I learned about variables, loops, testing, debugging, data structures, algorithms, Big O, and more. I have a special place in my heart for Professor Eric Grimson who instilled me with love for programming. It took me about two weeks to complete the course.

## Web

By the time I completed the Python course, I made up my mind to become a web developer. I made an account on freecodecamp and dove into web development. I picked up HTML in a couple of days and CSS and Bootstrap in a week. As my final CSS project I built a landing page for a fake company called Ketchunnaise which sells the mixture of ketchup and mayonnaise. Thus, I got the first two freecodecamp certificates.

After that, I went on with JavaScript. Thanks to the MIT MOOC, I already knew the basics of programming and switching from Python to JavaScript was a breeze. After learning the syntax, I started learning the DOM manipulation and jQuery. To be honest, I have never used jQuery after that, neither as part of my job, nor in my personal projects.

To help me focus on my studies, I bought the Forest app and used it everyday. I studied in small bursts of 25 minutes followed by a 5-minute break.  For the first month I had been consistently hitting 6 hours of focus time daily.
